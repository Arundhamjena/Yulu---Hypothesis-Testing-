## 📌 Objective  
Built an e-bike demand profile by analyzing a 100K time-series dataset for a leading e-bike rental company.  

## 🛠 Approach  
Employed statistical hypothesis testing (CLT, t-tests) using Python (pandas, NumPy, scipy, seaborn) for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis, while also handling missing values, outliers, and sample-based demand trend evaluation.  

## 🚀 Impact  
Identified a significant 10% higher demand on weekends and in clear weather using p-values, leading to a recommendation for increasing e-bike supply during these periods to maximize usage and revenue.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
Python (pandas, NumPy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn), Jupyter Notebook (for running the code and organizing the project).  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains time-series data on e-bike rentals, including variables such as season, weather conditions, day of the week, and ride counts.  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Higher demand observed on weekends compared to weekdays.  
- Clear weather conditions result in increased rentals.  
- Statistical tests confirm significant variations in demand based on external factors.
